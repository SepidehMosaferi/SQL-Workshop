# SQL-Workshop

This is a short description of SQL workshop. The workshop was presented by Sepideh Mosaferi at University of Maryland
College Park (December 14, 2016).


SQL stands for Structured Query Language. You may hear it pronounced in the
same way as the word ”sequel” or as S-Q-L. SQL is the language used to interact
with a relational database. A ”SQL database” is any database one can interact
with via SQL.

Common SQL database management systems include mySQL and postgreSQL,
but SQL also underlies the most common of database software - Microsoft Access.
SQL statements can be used to create tables, delete tables, add rows and
columns to tables, and query tables.
